# Subscribe to AI Unlimited

Subscribe to AI Unlimited on your CSP's marketplace:
- Azure (link)

***Maybe be specific about what they're subscribing to--it's the engine image but "feels like" more than that.***
 
***What do we really need to say about this task? We should not repeat what's on the Marketplace or provide self-evident steps--unless there's a good reason to.***
 
***If they have trouble subscribing, should they contact the CSP?***
  
***Where can they see their hours consumed or upcoming bills? Anything like that to point out?***
 
***Might they want to talk with us for help selecting an instance size? Can we point them to a blog entry or the Community--for any topics related to subscribing?***
