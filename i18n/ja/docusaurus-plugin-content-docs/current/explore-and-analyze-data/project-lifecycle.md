# プロジェクトのライフサイクル

AI Unlimited provides [magic commands](magic-commands.md) for creating and managing projects in Jupyter notebooks. 

If you create a project, you are its owner. Once a project is created, your Git repository owner can [add collaborators](../manage-ai-unlimited/add-collaborators.md) to the project in the repository. Back in the notebook, you'll need to update the engine for those new users. 

You might be the owner of one or more projects and a collaborator on others. While owners and collaborators can use the same magic commands, their points of view are somewhat different. 

The most fundamental magic commands reveal the overall project lifecycle, for both points of view. 

***A graphic with "steps," with arrows to show the flow and suspend-resume cycle. Will include the magic commands, and include details that support what's happening.***
