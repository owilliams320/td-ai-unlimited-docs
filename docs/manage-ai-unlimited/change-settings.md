# Change settings (for administrators)

***Might need 2 separate topics - old UI vs. new UI. Will figure that out when I work on Setup.***

To modify the setup information, do the following: 

1. Go to [AI Unlimited setup](/docs/install-ai-unlimited/setup-ai-unlimited.md) page.

2. Authorize using your GitHub credentials and select **SETUP**. 

3. Modify the required fields and update the section.

4. If you've enabled TLS, select **Restart** to restart the service and apply the changes.

You can then go to the **Profile** page to copy the new API Key.
